/*
    The Scanner class is used for reading data. When accepting user input, you must create
    a new object of the Scanner class with the argument System.in.

    Make sure you print something to the console first to tell the user what you're asking for,
    then create a variable to store the input you accept.

    Use Scanner class methods like .nextLine() for strings or .nextInt() for int, etc.

    At the very end, always use .close() to end the process.

    Any Java class which is meant to execute code linearly must have a main method.
    All code to be executed should be placed *inside* the main method. It has a specific
    signature, but you can use the shortcut 'psvm' in IntelliJ to create it quickly

    To execute code in IntelliJ, click on the green arrow to the left of the main
    method signature and then click on "Run `Shortcuts.main()`"

    The shortcut 'sout' will quickly create System.out.println()
